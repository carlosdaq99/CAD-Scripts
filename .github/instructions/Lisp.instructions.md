**AutoLISP Function and Code Reference Instructions:**

1. **Always check `AutoLISP_functions` for available functions before implementing new logic in any `.lsp` script.**
   - Reuse or adapt existing functions whenever possible to maintain consistency and avoid duplication.

2. **Reference Professional Grade Lee Mac Code:**
   - Before writing new code, read `AutoLISP_LeeMac_Bible` for best practices and advanced techniques.
   - Use `LeeMac_Enhanced_Categorization` and 'leemac_catalog.json'to identify Lee Mac programs that most closely match the script being created or modified.
   - All Lee Mac programs are located in the `LeeMac_lsp_programs` directory. Review relevant files for proven solutions and implementation patterns.

3. **General Approach:**
   - Prioritize code reuse, maintainability, and adherence to professional standards.
   - Document any deviation from Lee Mac or existing project conventions, with rationale.

**Note:** These instructions are in addition to the guidelines in `General.instructions.md`. Always abide by those instructions for module size, multi-stage planning, testing, and deployment.
